## 🚧 What Still Needs to Be Done

### 1. **Investor Approval Page** (`/admin/users`)
Create investor verification interface:
```tsx
- List of pending/verified investors
- View investor profile and preferences
- KYC document review
- Investment history
- Approve/Reject workflow
- Professional background verification
```

### 2. **Block User Access Until Approved**

#### For Founders:
Update `/app/founder/page.tsx`:
```tsx
// After profile check, add approval check:
if (founderProfile.admin_approval_status === 'pending') {
  return <PendingApprovalScreen />
}
if (founderProfile.admin_approval_status === 'rejected') {
  return <RejectedScreen reason={...} />
}
// Only if 'approved' -> show dashboard
```

#### For Investors:
Update `/app/investor/page.tsx`:
```tsx
// After profile check, add KYC check:
if (investorProfile.kyc_status === 'pending') {
  return <PendingVerificationScreen />
}
if (investorProfile.kyc_status === 'rejected') {
  return <RejectedScreen reason={...} />
}
// Only if 'verified' -> show dashboard
```

### 3. **Pending/Rejected Screens**
Create beautiful waiting screens:

**For Pending:**
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-yellow-50 to-white">
  <Card>
    <Clock icon with animation />
    <h2>Profile Under Review</h2>
    <p>Our team is reviewing your profile...</p>
    <Timeline>
      ✅ Profile Submitted
      🔄 Admin Review (Current)
      ⏳ Approval
      ⏳ Access Granted
    </Timeline>
    <Button>Edit Profile</Button>
  </Card>
</div>
```

**For Rejected:**
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-red-50 to-white">
  <Card>
    <XCircle icon />
    <h2>Profile Not Approved</h2>
    <Alert>Reason: {rejectionReason}</Alert>
    <Button>Update & Resubmit</Button>
    <Button variant="outline">Contact Support</Button>
  </Card>
</div>
```

### 4. **Email Notifications**
Set up email system:
- ✉️ When founder submits → Email to admin
- ✉️ When approved → Email to founder (welcome!)
- ✉️ When rejected → Email to founder (with reason)
- ✉️ When investor submits KYC → Email to admin
- ✉️ When verified → Email to investor
- ✉️ When rejected → Email to investor (with reason)

### 5. **Enhanced Admin Features**

#### Bulk Actions:
- Select multiple profiles
- Approve all at once
- Export to CSV
- Filter by date range

#### Search & Filters:
- Search by name, email, sector
- Filter by stage, status, date
- Sort by various criteria

#### Notes System:
- Admin can add internal notes
- View approval history
- Track who approved/rejected

### 6. **Dashboard Enhancements**

#### More Charts:
- Investment distribution by sector
- Success rate metrics
- User activity heatmap
- Conversion funnel

#### Real-time Updates:
- Live notification when new signup
- Real-time counter updates
- WebSocket integration

### 7. **Role-Based Access Control**
Ensure only admins can access:
```tsx
// Middleware to protect /admin routes
if (!session || userData.role !== 'admin') {
  redirect('/') // Block access
}
```
