## Design Principles

### Subtle Implementation
- **Small text sizes** (text-xs, text-sm)
- **Reduced opacity** (opacity-50, opacity-60, /40, /50)
- **Muted colors** (foreground/40, gray-500)
- **Uppercase tracking** for discretion
- **Secondary positioning** (bottom sections, after main content)

### No Dedicated Page
- No separate "Services" page
- No navigation menu item
- No banner or popup
- No prominent CTA

### Professional Tone
- "Select services" language
- "Curated branding packages"
- "Inquire" instead of "Buy now"
- Maintains editorial, trust-first brand

---

## User Journey

Users will discover this through:
1. **Passive discovery** - Scrolling through footer, about page, homepage
2. **Active search** - Looking through contact/legal pages
3. **Word of mouth** - Referrals to founder@incubazar.com
4. **Value-based discovery** ⭐ - Reading educational content and appreciating the quality
5. **Contextual need** ⭐ - Finishing the brand guide and realizing they need help

This approach ensures the feature exists but doesn't distract from the core platform mission.

**Most likely conversion path:** User reads brand guide → appreciates depth and quality → sees offer → reaches out

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If this becomes popular, could add:
- Dedicated `/services` page (still understated)
- Portfolio/case studies of past branding work
- Process/timeline information
- Pricing tiers (keep simple)

**But for now:** Keep it minimal and silent ✅

**Status:** ✅ Implemented across 6 strategic locations (2 added to learning hub)
