## üö® Important Notes

1. **Legal Disclaimer:** All legal pages include notices that they MUST be reviewed by qualified legal counsel before going live. This is critical for regulatory compliance.

2. **Logger in Development:** The logger will show formatted console output in development but will send to external services (Sentry, etc.) in production.

3. **No Console Statements:** The only console statements remaining are in `lib/logger.ts` itself, which is expected and correct.

4. **Contact Information:** Legal pages have placeholders for company address and phone numbers marked as `[To Be Provided]` - these must be filled in before launch.
