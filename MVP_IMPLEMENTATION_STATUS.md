2. **Supabase Storage Setup**: Ensure the `data-rooms` bucket is created in Supabase Storage with appropriate permissions.

3. **Continue Implementation**: Focus next on investor-facing features to complete the marketplace functionality.

4. **Integration Points**: The ReadinessChecklist component should be integrated into the founder dashboard for maximum visibility.
