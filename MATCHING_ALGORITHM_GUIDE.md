# Smart Matching Algorithm Guide

## Overview
Incubazar uses a sophisticated matching algorithm built entirely in TypeScript/Next.js to connect investors with the most relevant startups based on their preferences and criteria. **No Python AI service needed** - everything runs on Vercel!

## Algorithm Architecture

### Location: `/lib/matching/algorithm.ts`
Pure TypeScript matching engine with no external dependencies

### Key Components:
1. **Score Calculation Engine**
2. **Multi-Criteria Matching**
3. **Weighted Scoring System**
4. **Match Reason Generator**

## Matching Criteria & Weights

### Scoring Breakdown:
```
Total Match Score = 
  (Sector Match × 35%) +
  (Stage Match × 25%) +
  (Investment Range × 20%) +
  (Risk Profile × 10%) +
  (Location × 10%)
```

### 1. Sector Matching (35% weight)
**Most Important Factor**

- ✅ **Exact Match** → 100 points
  - Startup sector is in investor's preferred sectors
  - Example: Investor prefers "Fintech", Startup is "Fintech"

- ⚡ **Related Match** → 60 points
  - Startup is in a related sector
  - Tech-related: Technology, SaaS, AI/ML, Blockchain
  - Health-related: Healthcare, CleanTech, AgriTech
  - Finance-related: Fintech, Blockchain

- ❌ **No Match** → 20 points
  - Startup sector not in preferences

### 2. Stage Matching (25% weight)
**Very Important**

- ✅ **Exact Match** → 100 points
  - Startup stage matches preferred stage
  - Example: Investor prefers "MVP Stage", Startup is at "MVP Stage"

- ⚡ **Adjacent Stage** → 60 points
  - Startup is one stage before/after preferred
  - Stage progression: Idea → MVP → Early Revenue → Growth → Series A+

- ❌ **No Match** → 20 points

### 3. Investment Range (20% weight)
**Important for Feasibility**

- ✅ **Perfect Match** → 100 points
  - Fundraising goal within investor's min-max range
  - Example: Goal ₹15L, Range ₹10-25L

- ⚡ **Good Match** → 80 points
  - Typical check size fits the deal
  - Goal is 2-20x of typical check

- ⚡ **Acceptable Match** → 50 points
  - Within broader capacity (2x max amount)

- ❌ **Poor Match** → 20 points

### 4. Risk Profile (10% weight)
**Moderate Importance**

Risk levels mapped to stages:
- Idea Stage → Aggressive risk
- MVP Stage → Moderate risk
- Early Revenue → Moderate risk
- Growth/Series A+ → Conservative risk

- ✅ **Exact Match** → 100 points
- ⚡ **Adjacent Risk** → 60 points
- ❌ **Mismatch** → 30 points

### 5. Location (10% weight)
**Least Important**

- ✅ **No Preference** → 100 points (open to all)
- ⚡ **National** → 80 points (India-wide)
- ⚡ **Local** → Based on actual location match

## Match Quality Categories

- 🌟 **Badge**: Green "Excellent Match"
- **Description**: Highly recommended
- **Characteristics**:
  - Sector and stage perfect match
