## 🐛 Known Issues / Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No data persistence** - Calculations are session-based only
2. **No export functionality** - Can't download reports yet
3. **No historical tracking** - Doesn't save previous calculations
4. **No collaborative features** - Can't share with team members

### Suggested Enhancements (Phase 2)
```typescript
// 1. Add Supabase integration for data persistence
interface CalculatorSave {
  id: string
  user_id: string
  company_name: string
  calculation_date: string
  runway_data: RunwayOutputs
  ltv_cac_data: LTVCACOutputs
  // etc...
}

// 2. Add export to PDF
const exportToPDF = (results: CalculatorResults) => {
  // Generate PDF report
}

// 3. Add historical comparison
const compareWithPrevious = (current: CalculatorResults, previous: CalculatorResults) => {
  // Show trends over time
}
```

## 📝 Code Quality

### Type Safety
- ✅ Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ No `any` types in core logic
- ✅ Proper type exports

### Code Organization
- ✅ Separation of concerns (UI vs logic)
- ✅ Reusable components
- ✅ Pure calculation functions
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions

### Performance
- ✅ Client-side calculations (no API calls)
- ✅ Optimized re-renders
- ✅ Responsive chart rendering

## 🔐 Security & Validation

### Input Validation
- Number inputs have min/max constraints
- Percentage inputs capped at 0-100
- Currency inputs step by reasonable increments
- Required fields marked clearly

### Data Sanitization
- All numeric inputs parsed with `parseFloat`
- Default values prevent `NaN`
- Division by zero checks in place

## 📱 Responsive Design

**Tested viewports:**
- ✅ Desktop (1920px+)
- ✅ Laptop (1280px-1920px)
- ✅ Tablet (768px-1280px)
- ✅ Mobile (320px-768px)

**Grid breakpoints:**
- `md:grid-cols-2` for medium screens
- `lg:grid-cols-3` for large screens
- Single column for mobile

## 🎯 Success Metrics
