   - Click "Add Property"
   - Enter: `https://incubazar.com`
   - Click "Continue"

3. **Verify Ownership** (Choose ONE method):

   - Google will give you a meta tag like:
     ```html
     <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_CODE_HERE" />
     ```
   - Update `/app/layout.tsx` line 82:
     ```typescript
     verification: {
       google: 'YOUR_CODE_HERE', // Replace this!
     }
     ```
   - Redeploy your site
   - Click "Verify" in Google Search Console

   **Method 2: DNS Record**
   - Add TXT record to your domain DNS
   - Record: `google-site-verification=YOUR_CODE_HERE`

   **Method 3: HTML File Upload**
   - Download the HTML file from Google
   - Place it in `/public/` folder
   - Deploy

4. **Submit Your Sitemap:**
   - Once verified, go to "Sitemaps" in left menu
   - Enter: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"

### Step 3: Request Immediate Indexing

### Step 4: Create Social Media Images (Required!)
