# Waitlist System Implementation Summary

## Overview

- Approved users receive OTP via email
- OTP verification required for registration
- Auto-populated user details from waitlist

## User Flow

   - Founders provide: business idea, startup details, funding target
   - Investors provide: investment range, experience, sectors of interest

- Auto-generates OTP on approval via trigger
```

#### `otp_verifications` Table
```sql
- Tracks all OTP verification attempts
- Purpose: registration, login, password_reset

```

#### `users` Table Updates
```sql
- Added: waitlist_id (reference to waitlist)
